Add duration to song queue?

Add an exclude feature, to remove a song from the active queue.
~playlist exclude {index}

Doing playlist list {name} -l lags to a point it only lists the last array

Catching fish, displaying an image does not display the image. It drops a file
of the image, but it seems to have some errors. Need better links.

Inventory listing from stats doesn't italics correctly for fish that have
_ in their name. Should display without _.
