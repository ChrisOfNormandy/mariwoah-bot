# List of planned features needing implementation

* queue -l should include current playing song url.
* should have ability to purge / pardon specific warnings. Does not include kicks, bans or ban reverts.
* Saving to important files should happen through a queue system. Use a map: serverID: {[value: {args...}]}...
* modUser.js should be redone. It's trash.
* userInfoList.js should be redone. A lot of the code can be rewritten as a parent function with passed in objects.
* For the love of god, rewrite the roleManager adapter! So much junk that should have unique helper files or parent functions! WTF?
* Slots are broken.
* Fishing returns bad message when fish caught.
* Fishing can probably be rewritten and cleaned.
